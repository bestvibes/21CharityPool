A quick application for pooling and donating micro-donations to the BitGive Foundation. Currently, donations are set to 20,000 Satoshi, so I can flush the balance after every donation. Donations are then made to BitGive after the confirmed on-chain balance is greater than 100,000 Satoshi.

Please feel free to suggest additional Charities, and pull requests are welcome!
